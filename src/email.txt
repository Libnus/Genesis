Dear Dr. Maurer-Stroh,

I have just examined the slides attached and have a few questions before moving on. One is in regards to the sequence alignment and time complexity. I noticed on slide 45 you say dynamic programming approaches takes an extremely long time but I just did some digging into the other algorithms used in ClustalW for example where the time complexitity is stated as O(N^2n^2). A paper I found https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4554299 reduces this further to O(Nlog^2 * Nn^2) but in any case this is certainly slower than a dynamic programming approach found in say Needleman-Wunsch where we get O(mn) which is much faster. Is this discrepency due to the fact you are disussing multiple sequence alignments rather than a single comparison? This would make most sense as if you wanted to apply a dynamic programming approach an easy extension to Needleman-Wunsch is to simply make another comparison with the next sequence until you've compared all of them which is ALOT worse depending on the number of sequences you have ( O(N^2 * mn) ...yikes ). I am assuming that in the slides we are only discussing multiple sequence alignments and exluding single alignments from the picture but I just want to be sure.

The other question I have regards the molecular clock analysis on slide 73: can we always be certain that viruses will mutate/evolve at a specific rate, and if not, how can we be relatively certain that the estimate of the branching in 2010 (with Zika) is accurate? Furthermore, hwo can this be estimated with a high level of certainty? Is it just look at the tree and make an educated guess?

I will attempt to play around and familiarize myself with the software in these slides and the underlying algorithms used to get a better understanding of the concepts.

Thank you,
Linus Zwaka
